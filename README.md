# Car-Display
 So its basically a raspberry pi display that'd be mounted on an ATV for an e-BAJA competition, things it'll include are the temperature of the battery, motor, motor controller, battery SOC, motor RPM and speed of the vehicle along with other stuff.

![this is the final display i get,note that the backgroung and gui is all editable.](https://github.com/ayushgupta799/Car-Display/blob/master/IMG_20200215_130350.jpg)

Edit: this image does not conatain the stopwatch i added later whose push buttons were given to the driver's steering to map laps.
